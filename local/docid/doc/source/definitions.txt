_Release:_
>"A release enables you to mark projects, tasks, and folders for particular releases. It also helps you to
>keep track of which object versions were developed for each release."
>"When you create a new release, you can create it based on an existing release, and
>the new release inherits properties of that release automatically."

_Baseline:_
>"A baseline is an object (of type baseline) in the Synergy database which is related to various objects including
>tasks, project hierarchies etc which together represent a milestone in your development cycle."
>"A baseline is a set of projects and tasks used to represent your data at a specific
>point in time. A baseline has many uses. When you perform an update, Rational
>Synergy uses a baseline as a starting point to look for new changes."

Pitfall
-------

>"A baseline-project is a specific project object-version (of type project) which is in a static state.
>A working state project object may use a baseline-project as a start point for an update/reconfigure operation."

_Project:_
>"The database contains projects. A project is a user-defined group of related files, directories, and other projects.
>A project normally represents a logical grouping of software, such as a library or an executable, and
>it contains the directory structure of the files. Projects have version, like any other object."
