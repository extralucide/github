Check Inspection Sheet
**********************

Introduction

|loupe| This module check the coherency between SwRD or SwDD and Inspection Sheet file and **Change** and **Synergy** database.

- For SwRD and SwDD enter the folder.
- For Inspection Sheet, enter the filename of the Inspection Sheet.
- For Change query attribute *"Implemented for"* is assigned with the release extracted from the **CONTEXT** folder worksheet in Inspection Sheet.
- For Synergy query, baseline is extracted from the **CONTEXT** folder worksheet in Inspection Sheet.

This module also enables user to export an Inspection Sheet based on a SwRD with th following parameters:

- Change query attribute *"Implemented for"* which gives list of CRs to write on **CONTEXT** sheet.
- etc.

What is an inspection ?
=======================

"One of the primary objectives of **peer reviews** is to identify and remove defects in software work products as early in the software life cycle as possible.
An **inspection** is a very formal method of **peer review** where a team of peers, including the author,
performs detailed preparation and then meets to examine a work product.
The work product is typically inspected when the author thinks it is complete and ready for transition to the next phase or activity.
The focus of an inspection is only on defect identification.
Individual preparation using checklists and assigned roles is emphasized.
Metrics are collected and used to determine entry criteria in the inspection meeting as well as for input into product/process improvement efforts." [Westfall]_

Engineering peer review workflow
================================

.. actdiag::
	:desctable:
	
	actdiag {
	  planning -> review -> rework -> verification -> rework

	  lane author {
		 label = "Author";
		 planning [label = "Planning",description="Verify materials meet entry criteria. Schedule the meetings."];
		 rework [label = "Fix",description="Fix defect alone.If no defects are found, the review is complete."];
	  }
	  lane reviewers {
		 label = "Reviewer";
		 review [label = "Inspect materials",description="Defects logged"];
		 verification [label = "Verify",description = "Reviewer verifies defects fixed"]
	  }
	  lane moderator {
		 label = "Moderator";
		 moderator [label = "Control",description="Acts  as  arbiter  of  disputes"];
	  }
	}

Information parsed from SwRD
============================

- List of modifications of the release identified in **CONTEXT** worksheet
- Get documents in "Input_Data" folder in Synergy project according to baseline identified in **CONTEXT** worksheet
   (excluding "Data sheet" and "CCB_Minutes")
- List the requirements modified for the release identified in **CONTEXT** worksheet

What are the rules checked ?
============================

CONTEXT
-------

- Compare list of CR between **CONTEXT** worksheet and Change database for the release identified in CONTEXT worksheet

DOC REVIEW
----------

- Compute status in REVIEW and **DOC REVIEW** worksheet with this condition:
   Status is OK if the document issue in REVIEW and DOC REVIEW worksheet matches the document issue in CONTEXT worksheet
   and no remarks are logged and at at least a reviewer is identified
- Verify that SRS rules in DOC REVIEW worksheet matches SRS rules in SRTS standard

REQ ANALYSIS
------------

- Check that list of requirements in REQ REVIEW and REQ ANALYSIS worksheet matches the list of requirements in SwRD/SwDD
   (including check of issues)
- Check that list of upper requirements in UPPER REQ ANALYSIS worksheet matches the list of upper requirements in SwRD/SwDD
   (including check of issues)
- Check the list of upper requirements in SwRD/SwDD matches the list of upper requirements in upper documents.
- Compute status in REQ REVIEW worksheet with this condition:
   Status is OK if the requirement issue matches the requirement issue reviewed in REQ REVIEW worksheet 
   and no remarks are logged and at at least a reviewer is identified for all SRS REQ rules.

UPPER REQ ANALYSIS
------------------

- Compute status in REQ ANALYSIS and UPPER REQ ANALYSIS worksheet with this condition:
   Status is OK if the requirement issue matches the requirement issue reviewed in REQ ANALYSIS worksheet 
   and no remarks are logged and at at least a reviewer is identified

REMARK
------

- Check that numbering of remarks is an unbroken sequence
- Compute status of remarks with this condition:
   Remark is OK if the status is CORRECTED or REJECTED and verified issue is strictly greater than the origin issue
   and a CR exits and is a number (since the CR process start)

    SRS_REQ_39 is not "verifiable" as it consists in verifying that free text is used in the HLR body

How is it working ?
