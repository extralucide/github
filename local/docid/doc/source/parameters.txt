.. [#release] Definition extracted from "Rational Synergy Build Manager's Guide, Release 7.1".
    "A release enables you to mark projects, tasks, and folders for particular releases.
    It also helps you to keep track of which object versions were developed for each release."
    "When you create a new release, you can create it based on an existing release,
    and the new release inherits properties of that release automatically."

.. [#baseline] "A baseline is an object (of type baseline) in the Synergy database which is related to various objects including tasks,
    project hierarchies etc. which together represent a milestone in your development cycle."
    "A baseline is a set of projects and tasks used to represent your data at a specific point in time.
    A baseline has many uses. When you perform an update, Rational Synergy uses a baseline as a starting point to look for new changes.

.. [#project] "The database contains projects. A project is a user-defined group of related files, directories, and other projects.
    A project normally represents a logical grouping of software, such as a library or an executable, and it contains the directory structure of the files.
    Projects have version, like any other object."
