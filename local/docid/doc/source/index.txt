**doCID** allows project manager to:

- Generate configuration index documents in openXML format like
    SCI,HCMR PLD, HCMR board and ECMR documents based on *IBM Rational Synergy* and *Change* database

- Generate CCB minutes report based on Change database in openXML format
	Change Requests (CR) to deal with are chosen among a list of CRs resulting from a query according to attributes like:
		* detected on (ex: SW_ENM/03)
		* implemented for (ex: SW_ENM/04)
		* CR type (ex: SW_ENM)
		
	Table is created to list CRs with the following columns:
	
        * Domain: EXCR|SyCR|ECR|SACR|HCR|SCR|BCR|PLDCR
        * CR Type: ex SW_ENM
        * ID
        * Status: In_analysis, In_review, etc.
        * Synopsis
        * Severity: Blocking, Major, Minor, etc.
        * Detected on: ex SW_ENM/03
        * Implemented for: ex SW_ENM/04
        * Parent CR: ID | Domain | Type | synopsis | status

	Tables are created according to key CR transition (Reviewed/Postpone/Close)

- Export CR list in Excel files with the following column:

    * CR ID
    * Type: ex: EXCR|SyCR|ECR|SACR|HCR|SCR|BCR|PLDCR
    * Synopsis
    * Level
    * Status: 
    * Detected on: ex SW_ENM/03
    * Implemented in: ex SW_ENM/04
    * Implementation in baseline: ex SW_ENM_04_02
    * Modified time,
    * Impact analysis
    * Parent CR ID
    * Parent CR status
    * Parent CR synopsis
	
Block one::
